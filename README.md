# SmartRocket
SmartRocket based on Genetic Algorithm w/ p5.js

SmartRocket is project created by the Coding Train channel (Daniel Shiffman).
There is no difference between this project and the original one at the moment.

I'm using this repo as test to train Genetic Algorithms.

Things to change :
-Change fitness function to a squared fitness.
-Replace the matingpool (selection function) to a rejection sampling. -> Better performance ->  Bigger population.
